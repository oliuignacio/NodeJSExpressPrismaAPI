# Build APIs with Node.js

Welcome to the "Build APIs with Node.js" course on Frontend Masters! In this course, you will find comprehensive material on designing and building robust APIs using Node.js, Express, Prisma, TypeScript, and JWT authentication. It also covers deployment using the Render platform.

## Course Overview

This course material covers the following topics:

1. Building an API using Express: You will explore how to handle routes and create a RESTful API using the Express framework in Node.js.

2. Database Integration with Postgres and Prisma: The course covers the integration of a Postgres database using Prisma, which provides an ORM for seamless database operations.

3. Adding Authentication with JWTs: You will learn how to implement JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints and protect sensitive data.

4. Deployment with Render: The course material guides you through the deployment process using the Render platform, a managed hosting solution for Node.js applications.

## Tools and Technologies

To follow along with this course, you will need the following tools and technologies:

- Node.js: We'll be using Node.js as the runtime environment, leveraging its rich ecosystem and familiarity with JavaScript.

- Express: Express is a popular and lightweight framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.

- Postgres: The course utilizes Postgres as the database of choice for its widespread adoption and extensive deployment options.

- Prisma: Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database interaction and supports multiple databases, including Postgres.

- TypeScript: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, providing enhanced developer productivity and improved code quality.

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): JWTs are a secure and compact way of transmitting information between parties, commonly used for authentication and authorization.

- Render: Render is a platform that simplifies the deployment and management of Node.js applications.

## Folder Structure

To organize the project material while following the course, you can utilize the suggested folder structure:

- `00. Notes`: This folder contains your personal notes in a word document or any other preferred format.

- `01. vanillaNodeAPI`: This folder represents a basic Node.js project without any frameworks or external libraries, which serves as a starting point to learn the fundamentals.

- `02. Project`: The actual application that you build throughout the course resides in this folder. Here, you'll implement Express, integrate with Postgres using Prisma, add authentication with JWTs, and deploy to Render.

Feel free to modify the folder structure to suit your preferences or project requirements.
