# Build APIs with Node.js

Welcome to the "Build APIs with Node.js" course on Frontend Masters! In this course, you will learn how to design and build robust APIs using Node.js, Express, Prisma, TypeScript, and JWT authentication. You'll also discover how to deploy your API using the Render platform.

## Course Overview

In this course, you will cover the following topics:

1. Building an API using Express: You'll learn how to handle routes and create a RESTful API using the Express framework in Node.js.

2. Database Integration with Postgres and Prisma: You'll explore how to interact with a Postgres database using Prisma, which provides an ORM for seamless database operations.

3. Adding Authentication with JWTs: You'll implement JWT-based authentication to secure your API endpoints and protect sensitive data.

4. Deployment with Render: You'll learn how to deploy your API to the Render platform, a managed hosting solution for Node.js applications.

## Tools and Technologies

To follow along with this course, you'll need the following tools and technologies:

- Node.js: We'll be using Node.js as our runtime environment, leveraging its rich ecosystem and familiarity with JavaScript.

- Express: Express is a popular and lightweight framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.

- Postgres: We'll use Postgres as our database of choice for its widespread adoption and extensive deployment options.

- Prisma: Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database interaction and supports multiple databases, including Postgres.

- TypeScript: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, providing enhanced developer productivity and improved code quality.

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): JWTs are a secure and compact way of transmitting information between parties, commonly used for authentication and authorization.

- Render: Render is a platform that simplifies the deployment and management of Node.js applications.

## Folder Structure

To organize your project as you progress through the course, you can follow the suggested folder structure:

- `00. Notes`: This folder contains your personal notes in a word document or any other preferred format.

- `01. vanillaNodeAPI`: In this folder, you can create a basic Node.js project without any frameworks or external libraries. It will serve as a starting point for learning the fundamentals.

- `02. Project`: This folder will hold the actual application that you build throughout the course. Here, you'll implement Express, integrate with Postgres using Prisma, add authentication with JWTs, and deploy to Render.

Feel free to modify the folder structure to suit your preferences or project requirements.
